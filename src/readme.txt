Portfolio_game </br>
</br>
</br>

A program/game which displays my portfolio pieces. Move with mouse and wasd (or mouse and arrow keys), and then click on the articles within the room to either bring up a new room (folder) or interact with a piece of the portfolio). The idea behind the porfolio is that it is just reading through folders and finding the files within those folders so other portfolio pieces can be easily added.</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--If you click outside the menu while it is paused it should remove the menu and unpause.</br>
--When a program has been started from within portfolio portfolio becomes unresponsive (it continues fine after the started program is closed though)</br>
--Buttons don't reposition properly when resizing the window  </br>
--A 'Return' button is needed to allow the user to go back up a folder</br>

</br>
</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--Video article/portfolio piece type needs to be implemented</br>
--Nicer UI/make everything look nicer</br>
--More efficient/faster loading/optimization etc. </br>
--Many functions need to be tidied up</br>
--Many functions use global variables when it is not necessary</br>
-- Nicer font rendering </br>
-- Various classes/functions/blocks aren't actually being used currenlty, they need to be either implemented or remove. </br>
-- Better commenting of code, currently some comments are in the .h file and some in .cpp </br>
