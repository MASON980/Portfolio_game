DistanceDisplayer </br>
</br>
Visualises euclidean distance, manhattan distance and a third one I made up for fun. You click on the screen to set nodes then the screen will be coloured based upon which node is closest to each part of the screen. You can click on the node again to remove it and spacebar is used to change distance mode. Resolution of the screen (number of 'parts' of the screen) can be changed with up and down. Size of each individual part can be changed with left and right.</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--Only 6 nodes can be made (you would solve this by adding more colours, make the program generate different colours, or using that map algorithm to always have different colours touch each other).</br>
</br>
</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--Add more distance modes (if they exist).</br>
</br>

BUGS: </br>
--Unkown
