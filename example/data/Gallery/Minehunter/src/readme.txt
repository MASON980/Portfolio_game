Minehunter </br>
</br>
Clone of Minesweeper. Puzzle game where the player must find which tiles contain mines.</br>
This was made for education and what not, please don't sue.</br>
</br>
V1
</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--Some of the colourings of the tiles make it hard for user to see what the text is on that tile (the colours for '0', '4' are some of the offenders).</br>
</br>
</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--It doesn't look very nice (including better feedback for losses).</br>
--Give user option to change field size, and number of mines.</br>
</br>
