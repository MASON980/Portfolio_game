Collision Avoidance - ORCA </br>
</br>
Collision Avoidance - Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance? Collision avoidance for agents, they are spawned and need to reach a goal without hitting each other. You can pause the simulation and them highlight an agent to find information that agent.</br>
</br>
V1
</br>

ISSUES: </br>
--Agents can spawn on top of each other (current work around is count each of those collision as x1000 to easily differentiate).</br>
</br>
</br>

TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)</br>
--Multiple types of agents, some bounce of each other on hit instead of being removed, some have multiple goals (perhaps even more complex goals than reach destination)</br>
--Make the algorithm better (both accuracy and efficiency).</br>
-- Nicer font rendering </br>
-- Various classes/functions/blocks aren't actually being used currenlty, they need to be either implemented or remove. </br>
-- Better commenting of code, currently some comments are in the .h file and some in .cpp </br>
-- Find out if the algorithm is actually Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidaince </br>
</br>

BUGS: </br>
